Upgrading from ng-grid 2.0.x to ui-grid 3.0

1. Module name has changed from nggrid to ui.grid
   directive name has changed from ng-grid to ui-grid. Before:
```html
<div ng-grid="{ data: data }"></div>
```
```javascript
angular.module('yourModule', ['ngGrid'];
```

After:
```html
<div ui-grid="{ data: data }"></div>
```
```javascript
angular.module('yourModule', ['ui.grid'];
```

2. A string value in options.columnDefs is no longer supported.  ColumnDefs are now always watched via $watchCollection. Before:
```javascript
$scope.myColDefs = {[...]};
$scope.gridOptions.columnDefs = 'myColDefs'
```

After:
```javascript
$scope.gridOptions.columnDefs = $scope.myColDefs = {[...]};
or 
$scope.gridOptions.columnDefs = {[...]};
```
